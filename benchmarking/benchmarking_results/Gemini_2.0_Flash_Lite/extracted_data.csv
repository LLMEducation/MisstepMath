64,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Shape Identification and Part-Whole Relationship,"The student may be having trouble identifying equal parts or understanding the concept of fractions as 'pieces of a whole'. They might focus on the total number of shapes present, instead of the shaded or marked parts when asked a 'what fraction is shaded' question."
65,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of equal parts. They may count the whole shape instead of focusing on individual shaded or unshaded portions. For example, if presented with a circle divided into 4 parts and 1 part is shaded, they might state there are '5 parts' or incorrectly identify the shaded portion as being the whole circle."
66,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to identify the equal-sized portions of a shape when shaded. They may miscount or visually misinterpret the 'parts' in relation to the 'whole'.
67,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of equal parts. They may not grasp the idea that parts of a whole need to be the same size or that the number of parts affects the fraction. For example, when asked to color half of a shape, they might color a non-symmetrical portion, thinking any colored section qualifies."
68,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the fractional parts of a whole with the quantity of objects. For example, if shown a circle cut into four equal parts and asked 'How many pieces?', the student might say 'four', correctly identifying the number of pieces, but not grasp the concept that these are *fourths* of the circle. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relationship between the parts and the whole as fractions."
69,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visualize and represent the fractional parts correctly.

94,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add the numbers instead of grouping them for multiplication, or miscounts the objects being grouped."
95,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student misunderstands the concept of 'groups of' and attempts to add all numbers in the problem together instead of understanding that each group represents a count to be multiplied.
96,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the problem as repeated addition but struggles with keeping track of the groups or elements being added, potentially mixing them up and losing count. They may also not fully grasp the concept of 'groups of'."
97,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to solve the problem using repeated addition but miscounts the groups or the objects within a group. They may also add the numbers incorrectly.
98,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'multiply' the individual digits instead of understanding repeated addition. For instance, when asked to multiply 2 groups of 3, they might say '2 times 3 is...6 and 2 times 3 is also 6, so it's 6 and 6!' (leading to an answer of 12 or some other incorrect combination)"
99,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to multiply each individual number, ignoring the grouping concept. For example, in a problem like '3 groups of 2 cookies each', the student might calculate 3x2 and get 6, but in an effort to apply their understanding of addition, they might also try to separately multiply the 3 and the 2 by some value, and add all resulting values together. For instance, they may see the numbers as individual, isolated values, not part of a group and perform a random sequence of operations. "
100,K3,Numbers and Operations,introduction to multiplication,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'add' the multipliers in the multiplication problem, rather than understanding repeated addition or grouping. For example, if the problem is 2 x 3, the student might answer '5' (2+3)."
1,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confused tenths and hundredths, or did not understand the place value of the decimal. For example, if the problem was 0.5 + 0.25, they might answer 0.3 (thinking 5+2 = 7, and then misplacing the decimal to get 0.3) or 0.75 without understanding place values correctly. Or if the problem involved finding a fraction of a number (e.g. 1/2 of 4), the student correctly understands it as 'division by 2', but makes a calculation error like getting 1 instead of 2. For a word problem like, 'Sarah ate 1/4 of her pizza, and John ate 1/2 of his. If both pizzas were the same size, how much more pizza did John eat?', the student might focus on adding the fractions and respond that John and Sarah ate 3/4 of the pizzas combined instead of solving 1/2-1/4 to determine the difference."
2,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student is confused about the meaning of fractions and decimals in the context of the word problem. They might focus on individual numbers without understanding the relationship between parts and the whole. They may also treat the decimal as a whole number or misinterpret the unit of measurement.
3,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add fractions and decimals without understanding the need for a common denominator or place value alignment, potentially just adding numerators and digits directly.

9,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses fractions and decimals, possibly trying to add the numerator and denominator of a fraction directly to a decimal without proper conversion, or misunderstands the place value of decimals. For example, if the problem is related to adding 1/2 and 0.3, the student might say the answer is '1.5' because they added the '1' from the 1/2 to the '0.3' and then just put them side by side."
10,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the relationship between fractions and decimals, potentially treating them as separate entities and not recognizing their equivalence. They may also struggle with proportional reasoning or the relative sizes of numbers less than one."
11,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply the concept of 'more' and 'less' directly to the fraction and decimal, without understanding their relative values or how they relate to a whole. Might incorrectly think a smaller number like 0.2 is 'more' than a larger fraction like 1/2 if only focusing on the digits."
12,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the whole number quantity with the fractional part, believing the remaining amount after a fraction is subtracted is the same as the original whole. For example, if the problem involves 10 cookies and eating 1/2, they may think they still have 1/2 a box of cookies instead of 5 cookies. The student might also attempt to add or subtract the whole number from the fractional portion without proper conversions or understanding the relationship between the two."

19,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the fractional part with the whole number or treats the decimal as a separate, unconnected number. For example, if the problem involves adding 1/2 and 0.5, the student might add 1+0 and 2+5 and then combine it or incorrectly add 1 and 0.5, disregarding the denominator of 2 completely."
20,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student adds the whole numbers and decimals separately, misunderstanding the place value relationship. For example, given 2.5 + 1.3, the student answers 3.8 as 2+1=3 and 5+3 = 8, forgetting the decimal."
21,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply a rule they learned (likely for whole numbers) to fractions/decimals without fully understanding their properties.

22,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the numerator and denominator when converting a fraction to a decimal or vice versa, possibly thinking 1/2 is equal to 2. They might also struggle to represent parts of a whole accurately."
23,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to add unlike units (fractions and whole numbers) directly without converting or understanding the relationship between the different representations of numbers. They might add the numerators/decimals directly to the whole numbers.
24,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands decimal place value or incorrectly aligns decimal points during addition or subtraction. They might add the whole numbers and then append the decimal parts without considering their place value, or simply make a calculation error due to inexperience with the concept."
25,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the relationship between tenths and hundredths and incorrectly converts a tenth to a hundredth. For example, if the problem involves adding 0.1 and 0.05, they might add 0.1 and 0.05 to get 0.15 incorrectly, treating the 0.1 as 1/10 and mistakenly thinking it's the same as 10/100 like the 0.05 represents in terms of 1/100."
26,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the decimal point as a separator instead of a place value marker. For example, in '0.5', they might see it as '0' and '5' separately, not understanding it represents five-tenths."
27,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes all numbers can be added together in a problem regardless of the operation or context, mixing whole numbers, decimals and fractions without understanding their place values or relative sizes. For example, adding the whole number part of a fraction or decimal directly to the denominator or decimal places."
28,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses tenths and hundredths, possibly misinterpreting decimal place value. They may also struggle with the concept of 'half' in relation to a decimal like 0.5."
29,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets fractions and decimals as whole numbers and performs basic addition or subtraction without understanding the proportional relationships represented. For example, they might be asked 'Sarah has 1/2 of a pizza. John eats 0.3 of the pizza. How much pizza is left?' and the student responds with 0.2 or 0.5 because they treat 1/2 and 0.3 as if they could directly be subtracted, or added as a sum without finding a common unit or context (like the whole pizza). They may also incorrectly treat 0.3 as simply 3."
30,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of fractions as parts of a whole. They might treat the numerator and denominator as separate numbers to operate on, or misinterpret the meaning of the decimal point. For example, if the problem asks 'What is 1/2 + 0.5?', the student might add the numerators (1+0=1) and then separately add the denominator (2+5=7), resulting in an answer unrelated to the question (e.g., thinking 1/7 is the answer).

33,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses fractions and decimals, potentially treating them as whole numbers or misinterpreting their values. For example, if the problem involves adding 1/2 and 0.5, the student might just add 1 and 5 and get 6, or think they're the same thing and just write down one of the numbers. Alternatively, they might not understand that 0.5 means half, and therefore struggle to relate the numbers, or they might misinterpret 0.5 as 'zero point five units', rather than half a unit."
34,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student tries to add fractions and decimals directly without converting them to a common form (either both fractions or both decimals).

How much pizza do they have together?', the student might: 1. Add the whole numbers separately (0+1). 2. Convert the fraction to a decimal incorrectly (e.g., 1/4 = 0.1 or 0.2, not understanding the precise relationship.) 3. Add these incorrect values together. Another possibility is the student might just state two numbers from the problem and the fraction or decimal signs as their answer, without understanding the question."
43,K5,Numbers and Operations,word problems involving fractions and decimals,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands decimal place value and thinks 0.5 is bigger than 0.7, or misinterprets the word 'more' as something related to whole numbers.

64,K1,Geometry,Circles and rectangles into parts,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the area calculation for rectangles and circles, potentially attempting to 'add' the shapes together without proper consideration for their distinct features. They might also be struggling with spatial reasoning and visualizing how shapes fit together, particularly if the problem involves dividing the shapes into parts (like halves or quarters)."
65,K1,Geometry,Circles and rectangles into parts,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand that circles and rectangles can be divided into smaller, equal parts and sees them as indivisible objects. They may also focus on the shape's overall appearance rather than its ability to be partitioned.

66,K1,Geometry,Circles and rectangles into parts,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to count or group objects without correctly understanding the relationship between the circle and rectangle parts, potentially treating them as independent entities. The student might also incorrectly assume that the number of parts is related to the number of sides or corners visible, or tries to combine lengths of sides without proper context or knowledge. In addition, the student might misunderstand the concept of parts and confuse them with individual whole shapes within the larger shape."
67,K1,Geometry,Circles and rectangles into parts,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to conceptually grasp the idea of dividing shapes into equal parts, focusing instead on adding or subtracting the number of sides, or possibly seeing shapes as individual objects rather than areas to be partitioned. For example, presented with a circle and asked to divide it into two equal parts, the student might draw a line through the middle but then state, 'Now it has three sides! One, two, three!' (focusing on the drawn line as a new side). Or, when splitting a rectangle into parts they might just draw lines anywhere without regard for equal sized pieces. The student may not understand what 'equal' means in this context, or might simply count the individual objects created (e.g., the line), rather than the area. The concept of 'halves' and 'quarters' is not understood.

100,K1,Geometry,Circles and rectangles into parts,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands area and attempts to divide the perimeter or the number of shapes into the number of parts, incorrectly associating division with splitting the shape's interior. For example, when splitting a rectangle into halves, they might count the sides or the corners and divide them, instead of the space inside. Or, with circles and rectangles, they might just count 'things' and divide. The student may also not fully grasp the concept of equal parts, leading to uneven divisions and miscounting the parts.

For example, given a table with 'Number of Apples' and 'Cost', they might just multiply the last number in the 'Number of Apples' column by a random number without understanding the relationship between apple count and cost. They also might not realize that the number of apples is the variable that changes and the cost is the variable that depends on the number of apples."
71,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify the independent and dependent variables and incorrectly applies an additive relationship where a multiplicative relationship is present (or vice versa). For example, given the relationship 'Each box contains 5 apples. If you have 'b' boxes, how many apples do you have?', the student might incorrectly say that if b=2, then there are 2+5 = 7 apples, rather than 2*5=10 apples, or, if presented with a table, might see an additive pattern instead of a multiplicative one even when the table values increase by multiplying a constant factor."
72,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify the independent and dependent variables and how a change in one affects the other. They might confuse the input and output, or not see the relationship at all. For example, given the problem: 'You earn $2 for every sticker you sell. How much money do you make?' The student may not understand the relationship and say something like, 'I make 2 stickers!' or 'I need to buy 2 stickers to get money.' They may also confuse the amount of stickers as the dependent variable or not distinguish between the two."
73,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of a variable and struggles to identify patterns in the relationship between independent and dependent variables. They may focus on individual numbers without seeing the overall relationship, or may add the input to the rule instead of applying the rule. Example: If the rule is 'multiply by 2', and the input is 3, the student might write 3+2=5 instead of 3x2=6. They also might not understand that a letter represents a number and attempt to add it to a number when the rule includes the letter."
74,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student tries to apply the operation to only a portion of the terms, demonstrating a lack of understanding of variable relationships.

77,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student tries to apply the concept of multiplication to a situation involving addition and subtraction where it's not applicable. They might multiply a number by only one part of an expression instead of considering the whole relationship between the variables. For example, if the problem is: 'If Sam has 2 more apples than twice the number of apples Sarah has, and Sarah has 3 apples, how many does Sam have?' The student might calculate 2*3 = 6 and incorrectly add this only to the initial '2 more' to get 8 instead of properly calculating twice Sarah's apples first. The student doesn't fully grasp that the number of apples Sam has depends on BOTH the multiplication and the addition, independently."

For example, in a problem like 'Each box contains 5 apples. Write an equation to represent the total number of apples (dependent variable) based on the number of boxes (independent variable)', the student might mistakenly write the number of apples as the independent variable and the number of boxes as the dependent variable without clear justification and with a flawed mathematical representation, or they might get confused if the relationship involves multiplication or division."
91,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify the independent and dependent variables or misinterprets the relationship between them.

1,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student sees the equal sign as a command to 'do something' instead of a balance. They may add everything on the left side and then attempt to add something to the right side without understanding the relationship.
2,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student might be confused about what the equal sign means, possibly thinking it signifies 'and then' or that they just need to write down the numbers that are given. For example, if the problem is 2 + 3 = ?, the student might write down 2, 3 and possibly include the equal sign in their answer space, indicating that they might not understand that the equal sign represents equivalence and requires a numerical answer. The student might also just write down 5, but without the equal sign, demonstrating the same lack of understanding."
3,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as an instruction to perform an operation, rather than representing equivalence. They attempt to combine all numbers into one sum regardless of the equal sign's placement."
4,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand that the equal sign represents equivalence or balance. They may treat it as a command to add or simply put down a number they see.
5,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to count the numbers individually without considering the equality or total.
6,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand the concept of equivalence and may interpret the equal sign as 'the answer comes next' or as a direction rather than a balance. They might add all numbers together regardless of their position.
7,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to understand that the equal sign represents balance or equivalence and instead treats it as a command to add all numbers present. They may focus on the visual presentation of the numbers rather than their values.

9,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as an instruction to 'do something' rather than a statement of equivalence. They might add all numbers presented, regardless of the equal sign. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ?, the student might understand it as `3+2 = 5` but misinterpret `5 = 2 + ?` as needing to add up all the numbers and end up with 5 + 2 = 7, stating the answer as 7 or some other number based on incorrectly combining the values."
10,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign implies an operation needs to be performed immediately on what's shown on the left, without understanding its role in representing equivalence. They try to combine terms in a way that doesn't make sense, perhaps adding the numbers together from left to right, or seeing it as a direction to 'do something'. This is especially likely if they are used to problems presented solely as 'add these' or 'subtract these'."
11,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student might interpret the equal sign as 'and then' or 'the answer is coming next,' rather than representing equivalence. They might focus on performing the operation on the left side and then just writing a number related to the last number presented."
12,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' without understanding the equivalence relationship. The student might add all numbers present regardless of where they are positioned relative to the equal sign.
13,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unsure of the meaning of the equal sign; thinks it means 'add to' or 'put together' and focuses on the numbers and operations involved, rather than the relationship of quantities. Could also misinterpret the problem as a sequence of operations, performing them in the order presented without considering the relationship on both sides of the equal sign. Potentially confuses the order of operands in subtraction."
14,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as an instruction to 'do' something rather than a statement of equivalence. For example, given 2 + 3 = ?, they might correctly compute 2+3=5, but with 2+3 = 5 + ? or 5 = ? + 2, might misinterpret the location of the 'answer'. Could be an incomplete understanding of the commutative property. Also, potentially the inability to conserve number, viewing each side as a separate computation instead of a comparison."
15,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply the commutative property to addition with multiple addends but misinterprets it. They might rearrange the numbers randomly without understanding the equal sign's meaning as a balance or equivalence. For example, if the problem is 2 + 3 = ? + 1, the student might answer with a random combination of numbers related to the original problem. The core issue is a lack of understanding that both sides of the equal sign need to result in the same value."
16,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student treats the equal sign as a command to 'do something' rather than representing equivalence. They may attempt to combine all numbers presented in the problem regardless of their position.
17,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student interprets the equal sign as 'and then' or 'the answer is coming next' and doesn't understand the balance required on both sides. The student might also be counting the number of symbols or numbers rather than the value.
18,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses solely on the numbers presented and struggles with the concept of equivalence, potentially adding all numbers together or not understanding the need to balance the equation."
19,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as a prompt to simply combine all the numbers present, regardless of operation, or misunderstands the order of operations, treating it like a sequence to be performed left to right."
20,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts all numbers present on both sides of the equation and sums them, disregarding the operation or the meaning of equality. For example, for the problem 3 + 2 = ? the student might answer 5, while for 1 + 1 = 2, the student might respond 4. This illustrates a lack of understanding that the equals sign represents balance."
21,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the actions or steps and not the equal value; they may focus on combining numbers, regardless of the equality or may be unable to recognize that the sum on both sides of the equal sign are the same number. "
22,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly understands the equal sign as meaning 'put the answer here' without recognizing the need for the quantities on both sides to be equivalent. They might add all the numbers in the problem, regardless of their position relative to the equal sign."
23,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses solely on the numbers presented, often adding them together on the left side of the equal sign without understanding the need for balance or a relationship between both sides. For example, in a problem like 3 + 2 = ? + 1, the student might write 5, ignoring the right side, or write 6 if they added all numbers 3+2+1. They don't recognize that they need to find a value to make the equation true."
24,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the *appearance* of equality and attempts to 'balance' the numbers in some way, rather than understanding the relational meaning of the equals sign. Perhaps they see it as 'put these numbers together to get the same number on both sides'."
25,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the order of operations and doesn't understand the equivalence of the expressions separated by the equal sign. They might think they need to 'do something' to the left side to get to the right side, rather than the two sides being equal in value. For example, if the problem is '2 + 3 = ? + 1', they might write '5 + 1' on the right side because they added the numbers on the left and then copied the '+1'."
26,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as an instruction to add, or believes the numbers on either side of the equal sign should sum to the same number.  For example, given 3 + 2 = ?, the student might answer 5, or if given 3 + 2 = 4, the student might say, 'No, 3 + 2 = 6, or I need to add something to make the numbers the same'."
27,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as an operation that combines numbers rather than a symbol of equivalence or balance. They might add all the numbers present on both sides without regard for the equation structure, or they may not understand the separation the equals sign provides. The response will reflect that the student hasn't grasped the concept that both sides should have equivalent values."

30,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the order of operations and may try to solve the problem from left to right only, without understanding the meaning of the equal sign as representing equivalence. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ? + 1, the student might calculate 3+2 = 5 and then only write 5 as the answer, rather than finding the number that added to one is equal to 5"
31,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as a signal to 'do something' rather than represent equivalence. They may add all the numbers they see, not understanding that the equal sign separates two sides that must have the same value."
32,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the equal sign with the word 'and' and attempts to combine numbers on both sides, not understanding the balance concept. They might write something like: '3+2 and 5' or attempt to add all numbers present."
33,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the total number shown, ignoring the separation implied by the equal sign or misinterprets the direction of the operation. Possibly counts all the items regardless of the two sides."

41,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as an operator, often interpreting it as 'and then' or 'the answer is coming next'. They might focus on the order of operations and not the equivalence or balance the equal sign represents. Specifically, they may misinterpret the challenge question as a directive, or that they're supposed to just do something and write the answer. Could also involve issues with cardinality, particularly if comparing two different sets."

They might add all numbers together, regardless of which side of the equal sign they are on."
46,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to combine numbers from both sides of the equals sign as if they are related in a continuous operation, rather than understanding the equality represents two equivalent quantities. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ? + 1, the student might calculate 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and answer 6, or 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 and answer 4. They haven't grasped the concept of balance the equal sign signifies."

50,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the equal sign with the word 'and' or 'makes'. They might add all numbers presented in a sequence regardless of the position of the equal sign. For example, in a problem like '2 + 3 = ?' and then given a follow-up problem or extension '2 + 3 = 5 + 1 = ?' or '2 + 3 = 5 + 1 + 2 = ?', the student, instead of recognizing '5' is on both sides of the first equals and working on what the problem asks, will sum up all numbers. They are not using the equals symbol to equate the values, instead, they may regard the problem as an addition string."
51,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as indicating the act of adding, rather than the equivalence between two quantities. They may interpret the problem as a command to 'do something' or 'find a total', rather than a statement of balance. Furthermore, they might be relying on rote memorization or procedural understanding instead of concrete reasoning."
52,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student focuses on the visual layout of the numbers rather than the concept of equivalence. Might perceive the equal sign as a command to perform an operation instead of representing balance or equality. Could add all numbers together regardless of the equal sign.
53,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student believes the equal sign indicates the beginning of an action rather than the equivalence between two quantities.

57,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'and then' or 'put together'. They may focus on the action of adding rather than the balance implied by equality. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ?, they might add 3 and 2, and then write the 5 as the answer, understanding that the question mark is replaced by the result of adding them together and focusing on the process.

60,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add all numbers presented, ignoring the equal sign and its function. They treat the equal sign as 'and' or 'then'. They don't understand the concept of balance or equivalence."
61,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands that = means 'makes' or 'is the same as', but struggles with the abstract concept of equality representing the same value on both sides of the equal sign and might focus solely on the visual presence of numbers and symbols. They may focus on the order of the numbers rather than the sum. For example, if presented with 3 + 2 = __ + 1, the student might answer 3 (because it's the first number they see) or 5+1 because they are seeing all the numbers. Or the student might not understand that they need to add 3 and 2 first."
62,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student believes the equal sign represents a command to perform an operation rather than a symbol of equivalence. They may think it means 'put the answer here' and not understand the balance required on both sides of the equation.
63,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student understands the equal sign as a signal to 'put the answer' or 'add them all up' without understanding the balance it represents. They may also be struggling with the operation of addition.
64,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student treats the equal sign as 'put the answer here' and doesn't understand the balance required. They might just write the answer to the first part of the problem and not consider the entire equation.
65,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign indicates a command to do something rather than representing equivalence. They may attempt to 'combine' numbers on either side of the equal sign in a non-standard way, perhaps adding all the numbers present."
66,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student views the equal sign as a signal to 'put the answer'. They don't understand the relationship of both sides of the equation.
67,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here', focusing only on the operation side and not the balanced relationship. They might perform the operation on the first side and write the result, ignoring the entire equation."
68,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as 'the answer comes next' and doesn't understand the concept of balance or equivalence. They may attempt to add all numbers presented sequentially, regardless of the equal sign's placement."
69,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as a 'do something' signal rather than a symbol of equivalence. They might focus on the operation present and write an answer related only to one side of the equation, disregarding the need for both sides to be equal."
70,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign and treats it as 'and then add'. For example, given 3 + 2 = ? the student might write the numbers 3 and 2 and then add something, potentially unrelated."
71,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses solely on the number on the left side of the equal sign, potentially seeing it as an instruction to write that number, or misinterpreting the equals sign as 'the answer is'."
72,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student misunderstands the equal sign's function as a symbol representing equivalence. They may interpret it as an instruction to add/combine rather than show the same amount on both sides.
73,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the order of the numbers rather than the concept of equivalence. For example, if the problem is '2 + 3 = ?', the student might write '2 + 3 = 3' because they see the 3 first."
74,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign always means 'and then' or 'put together,' not that both sides have the same value. The student might perform an action on one side and then repeat it on the other, regardless of the original equation's components."
75,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student equates the total number of items on both sides of the equal sign, but does not understand the need for the quantities to represent the same value. They might count all items and think they have equaled."
76,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student misunderstands the equal sign and attempts to add all the numbers together regardless of grouping.
77,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' without understanding the balance or relationship between both sides of the equation. They may focus only on the numbers presented, not on the operations."
78,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'the answer comes next' rather than representing equivalence or balance. They might calculate the left side and write the result on the right, ignoring what comes after the equal sign. For example, in the problem '3 + 2 = ? + 1', they would calculate 3+2 = 5 and write '5' in the blank, not understanding they need to think about what + 1 equals 5."
79,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' and struggles with the concept of equivalence and balance. They may focus on the number on the right side of the equal sign as the only important part of the equation. The student may also interpret the addition symbol incorrectly, counting all numbers as separate entities to be 'added' together without understanding grouping or set composition. They may also have difficulty reading the equation or understanding how the different parts relate to each other, and may incorrectly perform simple arithmetic. The student will likely not be able to solve the equation accurately without more targeted instruction."
80,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as an instruction to 'add all the numbers' or 'put the total on the right', rather than an equivalence relation."
81,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student might believe the equal sign means 'and then' or 'the answer is to put together what is on the left.' They may focus on the physical act of combining rather than the symbolic representation of equivalence. For example, if the problem is 2 + 3 = ? and they have two blocks and three blocks, they might put the blocks together and say 'five' without understanding that 2 and 3 is represented by those combined."
82,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' without understanding the balance it represents. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ? + 1, they might write '5' in the blank without considering the '+ 1'."
83,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the order of operations and doesn't understand the meaning of the equal sign as representing equivalence. They may attempt to perform operations across the equal sign, treating it as a command to continue calculating rather than showing a balance."
84,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as a command to 'do something' or 'put the answer here', not as a symbol of equivalence. They might add all the numbers together on both sides of the equation without understanding the need for balance or different operations."
85,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as 'and' or 'then,' rather than as a symbol of equivalence, focusing on the actions performed rather than the relationship between the quantities. They might add all the numbers together regardless of the sign, or they might perform the operations in sequence without recognizing the need for balance."
86,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign indicates the *start* of an action or a 'becomes' sign rather than denoting equivalence. They might write the answer after the equals sign and not correctly represent the relationship between both sides of the equation. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = __, the student might write just '5' without any understanding of the relationship the equal sign is meant to convey."
87,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student is unable to conserve the quantity across the equal sign and might add/subtract the quantities in a non-meaningful way.
88,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student equates the equal sign with 'put the answer here' and ignores the relationship between the sides of the equation. They may also struggle with the concept of two sides having the same value and instead focus on a process to get a single final number.
89,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as a prompt to write something, but does not understand that both sides of the equation must balance or be equivalent. They likely misinterpret the symbol as meaning 'put the answer here' or 'do something'."
90,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student treats the equal sign as an operator, not a symbol of equivalence, and performs an operation on the entire expression, potentially adding the numbers on both sides regardless of their relation."
91,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand that the equal sign means the same as. They may interpret it as 'add this to that' or 'put the answer here'. This often manifests as writing down just the first number and ignoring the operation/numbers after the equal sign, or trying to perform an operation on the first part and then writing that number again."
92,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' regardless of context, potentially focusing on order of operations or solely the result of calculation without understanding equivalence. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ? + 1, the student might write '5' on the blank spot without any real sense of balance."
93,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand that the equal sign signifies the same quantity or value on both sides. They might try to perform an operation across the equal sign as if it were a plus sign, or simply state the answer is 'the biggest number'."
94,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign indicates a sequence of operations to be performed from left to right, rather than a balance between the two sides. They focus on the total quantity added and not the equality of both sides. For example, given 3 + 2 = ?, the student understands 3+2 as needing to be done, and then places the result as the single number on the right. For a problem like '2 + 3 = 1 + ?' they might add 2+3 to find 5, and then incorrectly assume the other side has to equal 5 and add 1+4 to get to 5, incorrectly thinking it is a sequence of steps."
95,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as 'and then' or 'the answer is coming up next', focusing on sequential actions rather than the balance it represents. They might also struggle to comprehend the concept of equivalence, especially when quantities are represented in different ways on either side of the equal sign."
96,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as a command to 'do something' rather than a statement of equivalence. They may add all numbers presented regardless of the equal sign placement, or they might treat the equal sign as 'put the answer here', only writing one number."
97,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' after the first number, not a balance between both sides of the equation. They treat the equal sign like an instruction or a place to stop writing numbers."
98,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the equal sign with the word 'and' or believes it signals an action to perform on the numbers presented, rather than signifying equivalence or balance. They might attempt to combine all the numbers shown without understanding their relationship."
99,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as 'put the answer here', rather than representing equivalence. May also lack understanding of counting all objects when combining sets."
100,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student incorrectly interprets the equal sign as 'the answer comes after' and may add all numbers present regardless of operation or structure. They may not understand the balanced relationship of the equal sign.
1,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Counting Misunderstanding,"The student struggles with one-to-one correspondence, possibly miscounting objects or skipping numbers when counting, or adding the numbers incorrectly."
2,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the visual appearance of the numbers rather than the actual quantity, potentially counting individual digits or confusing number size with their physical arrangement. They may also struggle with the language used in the word problem (e.g., misunderstanding the meaning of 'more than', 'less than', or 'altogether'). They may also struggle with the actual physical action suggested in the problem - needing to perform a physical act of adding or subtracting with concrete objects to understand the problem's meaning."
3,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to directly combine the numbers in the word problem without understanding the operation required (e.g., addition, subtraction). They might just add all the numbers, or pick a smaller number and a larger number and subtract, regardless of the problem's context."
4,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of 'more than' and instead focuses on the larger number or adds all the numbers present, regardless of the question's implied operation."
5,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to solve the problem but misinterprets the operation required. They might focus on key words like 'more' and incorrectly add when subtraction is needed, or vice-versa. They may also struggle to represent the problem concretely using objects."
6,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to count or add the numbers presented in the word problem but struggles with the context or the meaning of the words like ""more"" or ""less"". They might misinterpret the question asking for a total or a difference."
7,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to add the numbers presented without understanding the contextual meaning or the operation required. They might simply combine the digits or perform a random operation.
8,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'add' the words or numbers in the problem in a non-mathematical way, perhaps by just listing them or repeating them. For example, given 'Sarah has 3 apples. John gives her 2 more. How many apples does Sarah have?' the response might be something like: '3, apple, John, give, 2, more, how, Sarah, apple'."
9,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student counts the number of words in the problem instead of performing the required operation.
10,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'count on' from a number that isn't the first addend, or miscounts the objects being added. They also might not understand the meaning of 'in all'."
11,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly interprets 'more than' or 'less than' in the context of adding or subtracting. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 3 apples. John has 2 more apples than Sarah. How many apples does John have?', the student might say John has 2 apples."
12,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the core concept of addition and subtraction within the context of the word problem. They may randomly choose to add or subtract numbers without understanding the relationship described by the problem, or they may not use the given numbers at all, perhaps trying to guess the answer."
13,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of 'more than' and interprets it as simply adding the numbers given, without considering the initial quantity. They may also misinterpret the question and only provide the second number. This is particularly common if the problem involves comparative quantities or ordinal numbers."
14,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of 'adding more' and tries to guess the number or repeats the number from the question. For example, the question is: 'Sarah has 3 apples. Her friend gives her 2 more apples. How many apples does Sarah have?' The student might answer '2' or '3' without combining the quantities."
15,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply the concept of 'more than' by simply adding the numbers together, without correctly understanding the relationship described in the problem. They might also be confusing addition and subtraction concepts."
16,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Procedural Error,The student misinterprets the action in the word problem (addition vs. subtraction) due to keywords like 'more' or 'left'.
17,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with identifying the operation needed (addition, subtraction, etc.) and/or misinterprets the context of the word problem. They might choose the wrong operation, or add when they should subtract (or vice versa), or pick a number out of the problem at random."
18,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify the key operation (addition, subtraction) needed to solve the word problem. They might attempt to apply the operation that was last taught, regardless of the problem's context, or they may randomly guess an operation."
19,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to solve the problem using a strategy not yet introduced or understood, possibly random number selection or focus on a specific word instead of the whole problem."
20,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify and extract the relevant numerical information from the word problem, focusing on unrelated words or actions. For example, the word problem mentions 'two red apples and three green apples' but the student only focuses on the word 'apples' and provides a vague answer like 'apples'."
21,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of addition and subtraction within the word problem context, possibly confusing the actions or focusing on irrelevant numbers in the problem."
22,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to directly add the digits in a multi-digit number without considering place value, and/or doesn't understand the concept of 'more' or 'how many in all'. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 3 apples. John gives her 4 more. How many apples does Sarah have?', the student might answer 7 (because they see 3 and 4), without understanding the action and the context."
23,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Counting Misunderstanding,"The student miscounts objects in the word problem, potentially due to not understanding one-to-one correspondence, losing track of items, or misinterpreting the problem's context."

27,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unable to correctly identify the relevant information in the word problem, focusing on irrelevant numbers or operations. For example, if the problem is ""Sarah has 3 apples and John gives her 2 more. How many apples does Sarah have?"" the student might say ""5 pencils"" if the problem contained 5 pencils in its descriptive text, or might add the size of the objects mentioned together if the problem refers to 'big' and 'small' items."
28,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unsure how to apply the addition strategy to solve the word problem (e.g., counting objects, using fingers) and may misinterpret the problem's intent, focusing on isolated numbers instead of relationships. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 3 apples. John gives her 2 more apples. How many apples does Sarah have now?' The student might say '3... and then 2... so, three and two... um... 3 + 2?' while not executing the math correctly, showing either counting errors, or stopping at the number without properly accumulating."
29,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts the objects but doesn't understand the concept of combining quantities or adding. They might recount objects they've already counted, or simply state the number of objects present without recognizing the need for a calculation. Alternatively, they may understand the concept, but struggle with accurately counting and may be off by one or two objects in their final answer."
30,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts objects incorrectly, possibly skipping or recounting some, leading to an inaccurate total. Also, the student might not understand the question demands, providing the number of objects of just one type or just counting some objects and giving up."
31,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of 'more' or 'less' and reverses the operation needed. For instance, in a problem asking for the number of toys after giving some away, they might add instead of subtract, thinking 'more' means to add, regardless of the action described in the problem."
32,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses 'how many are left' with 'how many in total' and may also misinterpret the action of 'taking away'. They might simply count all the objects involved in the problem without understanding the subtraction concept.

37,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of combining quantities. Perhaps they misinterpret the wording of the problem as subtraction instead of addition, or they might only focus on the numbers and not what they represent (e.g., apples, cars). They also may not understand how to perform counting operations."
38,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student might misunderstand the word 'more' and add the numbers together directly without considering the context of the problem. They may also struggle with the concept of grouping or combining quantities.
39,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add numbers in the word problem but does not understand the context and adds the wrong numbers or adds them incorrectly.

They might not grasp the need to add or accurately identify the starting point for comparison.
44,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student might confuse the concept of 'adding to' with 'taking away from' or misinterpret the action described in the word problem. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 3 cookies. John gives her 2 more. How many cookies does Sarah have now?' the student might understand John taking cookies from Sarah instead of giving them. Or, they may not understand the action needed and instead try to subtract."
45,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of addition or subtraction, possibly misinterpreting the action described in the word problem. They might focus on key words but not fully grasp the overall meaning and how to represent it mathematically."
46,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the context of the word problem, potentially focusing on keywords without understanding the overall relationship or operation required. They might add or subtract when multiplication or division is needed, or vice versa."
47,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the meaning of 'more' and 'less', or struggles with the concept of comparison. Perhaps they focus on the number appearing in the problem without understanding the action implied by the words (e.g., 'has more' means add). Alternatively, the student might count one set and not the other, leading to a wrong conclusion."
48,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Counting/Number Sense - Combining Groups,"The student struggles with accurately combining quantities. They might miscount items or add the numbers incorrectly due to finger-counting errors or a misunderstanding of the operation (e.g., subtraction instead of addition). They might also have difficulty holding all items in memory while counting."
49,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Counting/Number Sense,The student misinterprets the word 'more' as addition but doesn't correctly perform the operation or struggles with quantity comparison. They might also miscount objects involved.
50,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the quantity being asked for, possibly focusing on irrelevant numbers or actions within the problem's narrative. For example, if the problem is: ""Sarah has 3 apples. John gives her 2 more. How many apples does Sarah have now?"" The student might say ""I like apples"" (irrelevant), or focus on John and answer ""John has 2 apples"" (misinterpretation of the question), or say '5 apples' and then change their mind, perhaps getting stuck on counting, not understanding the concept of adding two separate groups to make a new amount."
51,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to solve the problem using a method not applicable to the context (e.g., adding all numbers regardless of the question)."
52,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Number Sense - Misunderstanding of Quantity or Operation,"The student confuses the meaning of 'how many more' or 'take away' and attempts to add instead. They may also not fully understand the action of subtraction, visualizing the objects and perhaps counting to determine a sum without recognizing the need to remove or compare quantities."
53,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of addition with subtraction, or simply doesn't understand the overall operation required. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 3 apples and John gives her 2 more. How many apples does Sarah have?', the student might respond with '1' (3-2) or '5' without fully understanding what the question is asking, perhaps by focusing only on the numbers provided and arbitrarily performing an operation."
54,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the meaning of 'more than' or 'less than' and adds instead of subtracts or vice-versa. For example, if the problem states 'Sarah has 5 apples and John has 2 more apples than Sarah. How many apples does John have?' the student might incorrectly add 2 to Sarah's apples, so Sarah has 5 apples and John has 5+2=7 apples, but then misinterprets that answer and does additional operation (multiplies or divides those numbers) instead of stopping. Or the problem states 'Mary has 7 crayons. Tom has 3 less crayons than Mary. How many crayons does Tom have?' and the student may incorrectly add 3 to Mary's crayons (7+3), or simply state a random number."
55,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the action required by the word problem, focusing on a single number mentioned rather than the relationship between quantities. For example, if the problem is about finding the total of two groups, the student might just state the number from one group. Or they might start counting on their fingers, getting lost along the way."
56,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add the numbers from the word problem in an incorrect order, possibly adding or subtracting numbers they shouldn't, or misunderstanding the core operation required. The student might focus on key words like 'more' or 'together' without fully understanding the problem's context. For example, if the problem involves subtraction ('How many are left?'), the student might still add all the numbers they see."
57,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student tries to subtract the numbers regardless of the context of the word problem. They may not understand what 'how many are left' means in relation to subtraction.
58,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of 'fewer' and might add instead of subtract. For instance, if the problem is 'Sarah has 5 apples, and John has 2 fewer apples than Sarah. How many apples does John have?' the student might say John has 7 apples, thinking 'fewer' means combining them somehow."
59,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of adding or subtracting quantities described in a story. They might misinterpret the action (adding when they should subtract, or vice versa) or misidentify the relevant numbers in the problem."

61,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of addition and subtraction involving the same number, potentially focusing on the number itself rather than the operation. They may attempt to 'combine' the numbers in a way that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (e.g., adding and subtracting in incorrect order)."
62,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to solve the word problem by either adding all the numbers presented in the problem regardless of their contextual meaning or by misinterpreting keywords (like 'more' or 'less') without a solid understanding of addition or subtraction principles. They might also count objects or fingers but miscount or lose track.
63,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to add the numbers presented regardless of the operation symbols or context, focusing on pattern matching with a specific vocabulary word (e.g., 'all', 'together')."
64,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with one-to-one correspondence and counting, potentially misinterpreting the total number of objects due to skipping or double-counting, or not recognizing the relationship between the two quantities presented in the word problem. They might also have difficulty identifying the core operation needed (addition or subtraction) for the problem's context."
65,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of addition as simply combining the numbers, disregarding the context of the word problem.
