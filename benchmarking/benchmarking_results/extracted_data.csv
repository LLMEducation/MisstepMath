92,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,"When adding multi-digit numbers, the student might mix up place values, such as adding digits in the wrong column or incorrectly carrying over numbers. For example, in 4,237 + 2,569, they might add 7 and 9 and put '16' in the ones place instead of writing '6' and carrying the '1' to the tens place."
93,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student mistakenly interprets digits in multi-digit numbers by their absolute value rather than understanding their positional worth, potentially writing 1,234,567 as simply the sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 instead of recognizing each digit's place value"
94,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Misconception,"The student may confuse the position of digits and misread multi-digit numbers, potentially mixing up tens and hundreds places, or reading 3,456,789 as '34 thousand, 567 hundred, 89' instead of understanding the correct place value structure."
95,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Numerical place value error,"Confused about the position and magnitude of digits in multi-digit numbers, potentially mixing up hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands columns"
96,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"Misaligns digits when reading or writing large numbers, potentially mixing up thousands and millions"
97,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Misconception,"The student confuses the position of digits and writes 3,045,678 as 30,456,78, not understanding that each place value represents a specific magnitude"
98,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student might mix up the position of digits and accidentally read 5,237,468 as fifty-two thousand, thirty-seven hundred and forty-six, eight instead of correctly understanding its standard place value representation"
99,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student might mix up digit positions when reading or writing large numbers, such as interpreting 1,234,567 as 'one million, two hundred thirty-four, five hundred sixty-seven' instead of recognizing the correct place values"
100,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Comprehension,"When writing a number like 3,456,789, the student might erroneously place commas randomly or not understand their positional significance, potentially writing '3,45,6,789' or misaligning digit groups"
