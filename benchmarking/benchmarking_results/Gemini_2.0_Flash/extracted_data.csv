1,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Understanding Fractions as Parts of a Whole,"The student may struggle to visually identify equal parts, leading to an inaccurate count of the shaded portion or the total parts. They might not understand that the whole must be divided into equal sections to represent fractions."
2,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts the shaded parts, regardless of the total number of parts, focusing only on what is present rather than the fraction of the whole."
3,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to represent the fractional concept accurately. They may try to count objects without understanding the relationship between the part and the whole, or might simply guess the answer randomly, unable to perform the actual operation"
4,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding - Fractions/Parts of a Whole,"The student struggles to visually represent the concept of equal parts and might randomly select objects or groups, not understanding the need for division into equal sections. For instance, if asked to color half of 4 circles, they might color 1 circle instead of 2, or perhaps just select two circles that aren't adjacent."
5,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the number of equal parts with the size of the parts. For example, when asked to show 1/2 of a shape, they might color one part of a shape divided into three equal parts, or they might incorrectly try to divide the shape into unequal parts."
6,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to directly add or subtract parts without understanding the need for a common whole or equal shares. They may be counting individual pieces incorrectly or confusing the 'whole' with one of the parts.
7,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand that parts need to add up to the whole and incorrectly assumes equal parts of the whole always look similar, or correctly identifies parts and the whole. For example, when presented with a picture of a pizza sliced into uneven parts and asked, 'what fraction of the pizza is this slice?' they might respond with an answer like '1/4' simply because they see one slice and assume all slices are the same size as a visual cue, or when asked how many parts is the circle split into they will guess at the number of parts incorrectly, or when asking which parts make up the circle they will only choose some of the parts."
8,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to accurately identify and compare equal parts. They might confuse the pieces or count them incorrectly.
9,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with proportional reasoning and interpreting the visual representation of fractions. They may be counting individual shapes instead of focusing on equal parts, or not understanding that the total number of parts is the denominator."
10,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to visually decompose the shape into equal parts or may not understand the concept of 'equal parts' resulting in incorrect partitioning or counting.
11,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the equal-sharing aspect of dividing a shape into parts. They might count the sides instead of focusing on the areas of the resulting pieces, or they might not understand that the pieces need to be approximately the same size."
12,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses fractional parts with counting objects. When presented with a shape divided into equal sections (e.g., a pizza cut into 4 slices) and asked to identify a fraction, they might misinterpret the question and count the number of individual sections instead of understanding how those sections relate to the whole shape."
13,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to physically count the pieces and doesn't understand the concept of equal parts. May incorrectly count based on how the shape is divided, not necessarily the size of each piece. They also may focus on the number of visible lines or points and relate this to the number of 'parts'."
14,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of parts of a whole with the act of physically breaking apart or separating objects without considering equal shares. For example, when asked to identify 1/2 of a group of objects, the student might randomly separate some items, not necessarily into equal groups, and call that 'half'."
15,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts individual objects instead of focusing on the relationship between parts and the whole. For example, when asked to identify 1/2 of a group of objects, they might count all objects and give that number instead of dividing and identifying half."
16,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to understand the concept of a whole divided into equal parts and may focus on the individual pieces rather than their relationship to the original whole. They might count individual shapes or confuse the number of parts with the size of the whole.
17,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually represent and count fractional parts, potentially confusing the total number of objects with the shaded portion. They might also believe that each part must be the exact same size to be considered a fraction."
18,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of 'parts of a whole' and focuses on comparing individual elements instead of their proportional relationship to the whole. For example, if the whole is a circle divided into four parts, the student might identify one part as 'big' and another as 'small' without relating them to the whole circle's area. Or, they might count individual objects incorrectly."
19,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visualize and quantify fractions, potentially counting individual shapes instead of understanding the relationship to the whole. May also incorrectly identify equal parts."
20,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually compare the size of parts, potentially misinterpreting quantity or failing to see the whole as comprised of equal sections. May also miscount the parts."
21,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of partitioning with the concept of combining and incorrectly adds the parts to the whole as if they are distinct, unconnected objects."
22,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of equal parts and may not understand that all parts of the whole must be the same size. They might try to compare unlike pieces, or miss counting a portion."
23,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand the concept of equal parts and may be counting individual shapes instead of the whole.
24,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses equal parts with the total amount, focusing on the number of objects counted rather than the fraction representing the whole divided into equal portions."
25,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of 'parts of a whole' and treats each section as a separate, unrelated item instead of a piece that contributes to the totality."
26,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student attempts to add the numerators directly without understanding the concept of equal parts or the need for a common denominator (even if not explicitly named). They treat the parts as whole numbers.
27,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of fractions and the overall quantity. They might believe each part represents a fraction of a single unit instead of a fraction of the total amount.
28,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually identify and represent equal parts, possibly misunderstanding the concept of 'whole' or confusing it with unrelated objects. May also just be counting the number of objects presented rather than their relationship to the whole."
29,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of equal parts when dividing a shape and may perceive smaller sections as being a different 'part' than a larger section of the same shape.
30,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of equal parts when identifying fractional representation. They may not understand that the size of the parts must be the same.
31,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding - Fractions & Spatial Reasoning,"The student confuses the concept of equal parts. They might attempt to divide the whole into parts that *look* similar, but aren't actually equal in size. For example, if asked to color 1/2 of a shape, they may randomly color a section that is visually half but not accurately divided into two equal portions. Or, the student may struggle to distinguish between the *number* of parts and the *size* of each part, believing more colored parts always means a greater fraction, even if the parts are smaller."
32,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of a fraction representing a part of a whole. They might: 

1.  **Misinterpret the denominator:** Think the bottom number (denominator) shows how *many* of a specific item are present overall, not the number of *equal parts* the whole is divided into.
2.  **Misinterpret the numerator:** Think the top number (numerator) shows how *many* are present in the parts, and not the number of the *parts* we are considering.
3. **Cannot associate 'whole' with the entire shape:**  Focus only on the parts and not understand that those parts make up the original shape and its quantity. 
4.  **Count parts incorrectly:** Mismatch the number of parts, by missing a part or recounting some."
33,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand equal parts or the concept of 'whole'. They might count the number of sections incorrectly, or focus on the size/shape of the parts rather than their relative proportions to each other and the total."
34,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify and quantify equal parts of a whole shape. They may believe that simply drawing lines divides the shape into parts, without considering the size of each part. The student might also randomly color sections and not understand the relationship between the colored sections and the whole shape."
35,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly focuses on the number of shapes and not the area/size they represent in relation to the whole. For instance, if presented with a circle divided into four equal parts and asked to identify one part, the student might focus on counting the four parts rather than understanding what 'one part' represents in proportion to the entire circle."
36,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to count individual shapes without understanding the relationship of parts to the whole or incorrectly focuses on the shapes of the parts rather than the number of pieces making up the whole. For example, if presented with a circle divided into four equal pieces (quarters), the student might say there are three pieces instead of four, or count the straight lines instead of the sections."
37,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to conceptualize fractions and may be counting individual items instead of understanding a part-whole relationship. They might point to the object and say a single number, or incorrectly count individual segments regardless of the overall whole."
38,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of partitioning a whole into equal parts, possibly focusing on the number of pieces rather than the size of each piece."
39,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to visually identify and compare the relative sizes of the parts. May select a part that 'looks' bigger without considering if the shapes are equal.
40,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands how to relate the number of pieces (fractions) to the original whole and might attempt to count the pieces incorrectly, or add pieces even when they are meant to describe portions of a single, divided shape."
41,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of 'part of a whole' with simple counting. They might attempt to count individual shapes within a larger shape without understanding the relationship between the parts and the whole.
42,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses 'how many pieces' with 'how big each piece is'. They might count the total number of lines drawn to divide the shape instead of counting the resulting sections.
43,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of 'part' with the size or quantity of the entire whole, possibly thinking a larger whole always results in a larger part, regardless of the fraction. The student also may not understand the symbolic representation (e.g., drawing a part of a circle)."
44,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the number of objects present rather than the proportional relationship to the whole. For example, if the problem involves cutting a circle into four equal parts and asks 'How many parts are shaded?', the student may count the total number of parts (4) instead of the shaded parts if the answer is 1 or 2. Or, if they count, they may not be able to express a fraction. The student might also simply give a number without clarifying its relation to the 'whole'."
45,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student misunderstands equal sharing and may count individual parts instead of recognizing the fraction as a whole.
46,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply the concept of 'more' or 'less' directly to part-whole relationships without understanding the relative size of the parts or the whole. They might focus on comparing numbers without considering the fractions or proportions. They might also confuse the meaning of 'half' or 'quarter' as simply a smaller quantity, rather than a proportional division."
47,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of equal parts. Might try to count or add the shapes instead of understanding fractions or parts of the whole. Also, might not understand ""whole""."
48,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student thinks all shapes represent the same 'whole' regardless of size, and focuses on the number of shaded parts without considering the total parts."
49,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually decompose and represent the fractional parts. They might focus on the total number of elements present, or not correctly identify which part represents the fraction, maybe by counting incorrect sections or comparing different visual quantities that are not relevant."
50,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of equal parts. For example, when presented with a shape divided into unequal parts and asked to identify 'halves,' they might point to the largest part."
51,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student focuses on counting individual items instead of understanding the proportional relationship between parts and the whole; they might misinterpret the concept of 'fraction' as just a number of objects.
52,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding - Parts of a Whole,"Student focuses on the number of pieces instead of the size or proportion of each piece in relation to the whole. For instance, if shown a pizza cut into 4 slices, the student might identify the slice as 'one' without understanding it's one *part* of the pizza."
53,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands how to visually represent fractions, potentially confusing the number of shaded parts with the total number of parts, or misinterpreting 'whole' as a fixed, unchanging quantity regardless of the problem context. They may struggle to divide the shape into equal parts and/or to identify the designated parts representing a fraction."
54,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually identify and compare the different sized parts of a whole, assuming equal parts where they don't exist. They may also confuse the number of parts with the size of the parts."
55,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on counting individual pieces regardless of the whole's representation and size, likely confusing 'parts' with just a quantity of objects. They also may not understand the concept of equal parts, counting unlike sections as equivalent for their total."
56,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands how to combine shaded portions representing fractions, possibly adding the numerators directly without considering the whole."
57,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of equal parts and may not understand that all parts of the whole must be the same size. They might try to estimate sizes visually and incorrectly divide a shape, assuming the biggest or smallest sections are 'one part'."
58,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of equal parts or the relationship between the whole and its parts. They might try to count individual shapes within a larger shape without considering if they are actually 'parts' of the whole or simply distinct objects. For example, if shown a pizza cut into 4 slices and asked 'How many parts are there?', they might count the crust, the cheese, and the pepperoni as parts, rather than the 4 slices."
59,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses 'parts of a whole' with counting individual objects or focuses on visual similarities between shapes without understanding proportional relationships. For example, when asked to identify one-half of a shape divided into four equal parts, they might point to a single part, thinking that since there's one, it's a 'part' of the whole, or they might select two parts, but without a clear explanation of why. They are unable to see the proportional relationship between the parts and the whole, often focusing on appearance rather than the value of the divided sections."
60,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the number of 'pieces' rather than the proportional size of each piece when comparing parts of a whole. For example, if presented with a circle cut into 4 pieces and a circle cut into 8 pieces, the student might incorrectly believe the circle with 8 pieces is 'more' than the circle with 4 pieces, regardless of whether they are shaded to represent fractions."
61,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of 'parts of a whole' with counting individual items and focuses on a number sequence instead of the fractional relationship. For example, when presented with a circle divided into four equal parts and asked to identify one part, the student might say 'one, two, three, four' (counting the sections) rather than 'one out of four' or 'a quarter'."
62,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student misunderstands the concept of equal parts or area when comparing them. May focus on counting items within the shape instead of understanding relative sizes.
63,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands fractions as independent entities rather than parts of a single whole. They may attempt to count the shaded parts without considering the total number of parts in the whole figure, or struggle to relate the numerator to the denominator."
64,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts individual objects instead of understanding fractions as parts of a whole, possibly misinterpreting 'part' as a specific item. They may also struggle with identifying what represents the 'whole'."
65,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually represent and compare fractional parts, potentially focusing on the number of shapes rather than the shaded area or size of the parts."
66,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to understand the concept of 'part of a whole' and may be focusing on individual objects rather than the relationship between them. They might count items separately without considering the total.
67,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of equal parts and may try to 'count' parts without regard to their size, or misinterpret the total amount needed. They may also be confused between identifying the 'whole' and the 'part'."
68,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes that all parts of the whole must be identical in shape and size, regardless of the visual representation (e.g., circles, squares, etc.). The student also struggles with the idea of dividing a shape into fractions beyond recognizing ""halves""."
69,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unable to accurately represent the fractional parts of a whole, possibly focusing on counting individual objects instead of understanding equal parts."
70,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses solely on the visual size of the parts and doesn't understand the concept of equal-sized shares within a whole. May also have difficulty identifying the whole. For example, given a circle divided into unequal sections, the student might claim the bigger section represents more even if it's not defined by the 'equal' concept."
71,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of 'part of a whole' with simply adding or subtracting the given numbers without considering the overall shape or amount. They may also struggle with counting or comparing parts of a whole if the division isn't clear or visual. They may not understand that the shaded area is a part of the original whole.
72,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify the fraction representing a shaded part when multiple equal parts are present. They may count the shaded parts without considering the total number of parts, or misinterpret the meaning of 'whole'."
73,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to identify equal parts and may not understand the concept of partitioning a whole into fractions. They may count all the shapes, regardless of their size, or focus on features other than equal areas when comparing parts to the whole."
74,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts individual objects instead of considering equal parts of a whole (e.g., a pizza cut into slices)."
75,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the concept of 'part of a whole' only applies to physical separation (cutting) and not to visual grouping or shading. For example, if presented with a shape divided into colored sections, they might only identify a part as a whole if actual 'pieces' are physically detached, rather than if the sections are just visually different."
76,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the concept of equal parts and may perceive unequal partitions as valid 'parts' of the whole. For example, if shown a rectangle divided into one large section and a few small sections, they might identify the large section as representing a 'part' without considering it proportional to the whole."
77,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student confuses the concept of 'equal parts' with simply dividing the shape into any parts and then incorrectly attempts to quantify the parts without understanding fractions. They might randomly assign numbers to the sections without considering whether they represent equal portions of the whole.
78,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of 'parts' with counting individual objects, leading to an incorrect representation of fractions. They might also not understand that the 'whole' needs to be divided into equal parts."
79,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Shape Recognition and Parts of a Whole,"The student counts the shapes in a group but doesn't understand that the shapes are parts of the whole. They may also misidentify shapes or struggle with quantity representation. For instance, they might be shown a circle divided into 4 equal parts and say 'There are three squares!' and point to a triangle and a square near the whole. They may struggle with a simple fractions problem, 'If you have a circle with one part shaded, what do you have?'"
80,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with proportional reasoning and visualizing fractions. They may incorrectly count individual objects instead of understanding the part-whole relationship represented by a fraction. For example, if the problem asks what part of a group of 4 blocks is 1 block, they might respond by saying 'one', focusing on the single block without referencing the total."
81,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles to visualize the fraction and its relationship to the whole. May miscount or confuse the numerator and denominator.
82,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visually identify and separate the parts of the whole, possibly confusing the total number of objects with the number representing the parts of a whole. They may also incorrectly count the entire set as the 'part' instead of recognizing fractions as portions."
83,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes that when dividing a shape into parts, all parts must be equal in size and shape, even when the instructions do not explicitly state this."
84,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of equal parts and doesn't understand the need for equal sized pieces. They may attempt to 'divide' the whole by visually separating it, but not necessarily by dividing it into equal-sized portions. For example, if asked to color half of a circle, they might color a section that visually looks approximately half but isn't precisely half of the entire area. Or they might attempt to divide the whole into sections and then 'count' them, without understanding that counting only works for equal parts. This could also manifest as a counting error if they try to split the shapes."
85,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the number of parts with the size of each part. For example, when presented with a circle divided into 4 equal parts, the student counts the parts but doesn't understand that one 'part' is 1/4 of the whole, and incorrectly states how much of the circle is shaded."
86,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands how to compare fractional parts visually and counts the number of pieces instead of considering their size relative to the whole. For example, when presented with two shapes cut into different numbers of pieces, the student may incorrectly identify the shape with more pieces as having the larger fraction, regardless of the size of the individual pieces."
87,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unable to identify or quantify the parts of the whole, potentially counting individual objects instead of focusing on grouped portions."
88,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visualize and represent fractional parts. May count the pieces but not grasp the relationship of the part to the whole. For example, they might be given a shape cut into 4 pieces and asked to point to 1/4 and point to one individual piece or simply count 1 piece, without understanding it represents a portion of the whole."
89,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to count individual pieces without understanding the concept of the whole or how they relate proportionally. Might point to each piece and say a number, without realizing they are all 'part of something bigger'."
90,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand the concept of 'parts of a whole'. They might be counting individual items instead of focusing on the relationship of a subset to the entire set.
91,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of equal parts and may not understand the relationship between the size of the part and the whole. They might miscount or misinterpret what constitutes 'equal' parts, possibly focusing on the number of objects rather than their proportional size."
92,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the relationship between the shaded part and the whole, possibly counting the shaded parts instead of understanding the fraction of the whole that is shaded. They might also confuse the concept of 'parts' with 'amount'."
93,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses equal parts with visual similarity. For example, when asked to identify one-half of a shape, they might choose a section that looks similar in size to another, even if it's not exactly half or if the other half is of a different shape."
94,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding - Fractions as parts of a whole (area/region),"The student incorrectly identifies the equal parts or counts the parts incorrectly. The student might not understand that the parts must be equal in size to represent fractions. Alternatively, they may count the total number of shapes instead of parts of the whole."
95,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on individual shapes (like rectangles) within a larger shape and counts them instead of considering the area as divided parts of the whole. For example, given a rectangle divided into four smaller rectangles, the student counts the individual rectangles and answers '4' without understanding this relates to fractions of the total area."
96,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of 'equal parts' and may count individual objects instead of the whole, or misinterpret the visual representation of the whole."
97,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands how to divide a whole shape into equal parts, perhaps drawing parts of unequal size or miscounting the desired number of parts. They might focus on drawing lines without ensuring equal areas."
98,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes that visually smaller sections of a shape always represent a smaller fraction, without considering the total number of sections. For example, in a circle divided into unequal parts, they might incorrectly identify a small section as one-half, assuming it's half because it 'looks' small."
99,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of 'parts of a whole' with adding individual components and might try to add or subtract the quantities without understanding the proportional relationship. For example, if the problem involves shading part of a shape, the student might count only the shaded portions without considering their proportion to the total parts of the shape."
100,K2,Geometry,parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the number of pieces visible rather than the fraction representing the shaded area, possibly misinterpreting the problem as counting individual shapes instead of parts of a whole."
1,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Understanding Fractions as Parts of a Whole,"The student counts individual objects separately instead of understanding the group as the whole, and/or struggles with identifying equal parts."
2,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the parts of a whole with the whole itself and attempts to count individual objects, not the fractional parts. For example, when asked to identify 1/2 of 4 cookies, the student might count all 4 cookies and say they have 1/2 of the cookies, rather than selecting or identifying 2 of the cookies."
3,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to represent the shaded part correctly, potentially confusing the total number of pieces with the number of shaded pieces, or miscounting."
4,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to visualize or represent the fractional parts correctly, possibly miscounting the total number of parts or incorrectly identifying the shaded portion."
5,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding - Fraction Representation,"The student doesn't understand that the fractions represent parts of a whole and tries to add the numerators and denominators directly as separate values, or counts the pieces incorrectly without considering the total number of pieces in the whole."
6,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to correctly identify the fractional parts within a visual representation (e.g., a circle divided into sections). They may count the shaded parts correctly but misinterpret the relationship to the whole, incorrectly stating the fraction."

10,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts the shaded parts of a whole and then also counts the non-shaded parts, adding them together instead of focusing on just the shaded portion as a fraction of the total."
11,K3,Numbers and Operations,fractions as parts of a whole,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the number of parts shaded with the total number of parts and misinterprets the fraction. For example, given a shape divided into four parts, and two parts are shaded, the student might say the fraction is 2/2 instead of 2/4, focusing solely on the shaded parts."

22,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'solve' a ratio problem by adding numbers in a way that doesn't maintain the proportional relationship. For example, in a problem like 'If 2 apples cost $1, how much do 4 apples cost?', they might add the 2 apples to the $1 to get a final 'answer' that lacks meaning in the context of ratio."
23,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to maintain the proportional relationship and misunderstands scaling. They might correctly identify the individual components (e.g., number of apples in a ratio), but fail to consistently apply the same operation (multiplication or division) to all parts of the ratio when scaling up or down. For example, if the ratio is 1 apple : 2 bananas and they need to find the ratio for 3 apples, they might say it's 3 apples : 2 bananas because they only focused on changing the apple number."
24,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly focuses on the difference between the numbers instead of their relationship (ratio or rate).

27,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misinterprets the problem's context and attempts to solve it using addition or subtraction instead of ratio or rate concepts. For example, they might be asked 'If a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar, how many total cups are there?' and the student responds with '3 cups' but when asked a related question like 'If you double the recipe, how much sugar is needed?', they either add sugar to flour (e.g., 2+2 and 1+1, concluding 4 cups flour and 2 cups sugar) or attempt to find a difference (e.g., 2-1). The core issue stems from not grasping the proportional relationship represented by ratios."
28,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with proportional reasoning and incorrectly calculates the equivalent ratio, perhaps by additive reasoning instead of multiplicative reasoning. For example, if the problem states 'If 2 cookies cost $1, how much will 4 cookies cost?' the student might answer $2, incorrectly adding 2 instead of correctly multiplying by 2."

44,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses additive and multiplicative relationships in a ratio context, possibly by adding a constant to both parts of the ratio instead of multiplying by a common factor.  For example, if the ratio is 2:3 and the student is asked to scale it up, they might incorrectly interpret the 2 and 3 as separate entities to which they add the same number (e.g., 2+1 : 3+1 = 3:4) instead of multiplying to get, for example, 4:6."
45,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the concept of equivalent ratios with simple addition. They may try to add the same amount to both parts of the ratio instead of multiplying or dividing by a common factor.

70,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to find the 'total' in a ratio problem involving two parts by adding the given quantity directly to only one part of the ratio, rather than scaling both parts proportionally, demonstrating a misunderstanding of how ratios represent proportional relationships. For example, if the problem is 'For every 2 red blocks there are 3 blue blocks. If there are 4 red blocks, how many blue blocks are there?' The student may incorrectly calculate by adding the difference of the red blocks to the blue blocks, for example adding 2 to the 3 blue blocks, so 3 + 2 = 5, incorrectly calculating the number of blue blocks."

94,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply a pattern without fully understanding the underlying ratio. They might think it's always addition or subtraction, regardless of the multiplicative relationship. For example, in a problem like 'For every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges. If you have 4 apples, how many oranges?' they might answer 5 (2+3), not 6 (2x2 is to 3x2). Alternatively, they may get confused with units and how they relate to each other and incorrectly use additive relationships rather than multiplicative or even skip a step."
95,K6,Numbers and Operations,Understanding and applying ratios and rates,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to recognize equivalent ratios and may add or subtract values across the ratios instead of finding a multiplicative relationship. For example, if the problem states 'For every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges.

They may also struggle to interpret the directions and misinterpret the relationship. For example, they might reverse the relationship direction."
98,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to apply multiplication across a variable and a constant without understanding the need for a specific operation or pattern to relate the variables. For example, if the problem involves a pattern where y = 2x + 3, the student might write y = 2x + 3 = 5x (incorrectly adding the 2 and 3 with x in the expression, confusing the variable itself). Or, the student might interpret a simple relationship like 'for every 1 apple, there are 2 oranges' and incorrectly assume a direct numerical relationship that can be computed. It is most likely the student does not understand how the relationship is constructed."
99,K6,Algebra,Analyzing and using relationships between dependent and independent variables,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly applies the distributive property or struggles with identifying the relationship between variables, likely confusing addition and multiplication, or not understanding the constant aspect of a relationship.

They may struggle to distinguish independent and dependent variables and assume a linear relationship where one might not exist."
23,K8,Algebra,Understanding the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with function notation. They might see f(x) as 'f times x' and attempt to multiply, failing to understand it as a rule or input/output relationship. Also, they might add the 'x' to numbers inside the function rather than applying the operation within the function."
24,K8,Algebra,Understanding the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student thinks a function always results in multiplication; the student incorrectly applies the concept of 'input' and 'output' by multiplying a variable by a constant regardless of the operation within the function.

27,K8,Algebra,Understanding the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student thinks that a function operates by adding or multiplying the input by a constant, regardless of any other operations defined within the function rule. For example, if f(x) = 2x + 3, and they are asked to find f(2), they might calculate (2*2) + 3 = 7, then incorrectly assume the rule is simply adding the result to itself to find f(4). This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the function's consistent operation on its input. It also displays an unawareness of variable substitution, or the consistent need for that substitution."
28,K8,Algebra,Understanding the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand the concept of a function as a mapping, focusing instead on isolated calculations or assuming a linear relationship when it's not necessarily present.

Or, if it's a problem like 4 = ? + 1, they might say '4' because the equals sign tells them to find the number."
10,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student equates the equal sign with 'add' or 'put together', not understanding the concept of equivalence. They might combine all numbers presented regardless of the structure of the equation."
11,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to find the answer by adding and subtracting in a manner that is not mathematically valid, possibly adding all numbers presented to the left of the equal sign, then trying to balance it by subtracting an available number or a combination of numbers on the right side."
12,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Understanding the Equal Sign,"The student treats the equal sign as 'the answer comes next' or as a signal to 'add everything'. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ?, the student might write '3 + 2 = 5', which is correct in this context. However, if the problem is 3 + 2 = 1 + ?, the student may write '3 + 2 = 1 + 6', misunderstanding the balance of the equation and focusing only on adding all the numbers together. Alternatively, the student might write '3 + 2 = 1 + 5', as they find the first sum (3+2=5) and use that as the answer to fill in the blank instead of considering the other side of the equals sign."
13,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as 'put the answer here' and focuses on the operation presented, regardless of the value on the other side of the equal sign. They might just add or subtract what they see."
14,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of equality and may add all numbers presented, regardless of the equal sign's meaning. They may also focus on the order the numbers appear."
15,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles to understand that the equal sign represents equivalence and instead believes it signifies an operation or the 'answer' goes only on the right side. They may attempt to perform an operation on the left side and treat the right side as the expected outcome, rather than a balanced relationship."
16,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign means 'add the numbers together' rather than showing equivalence. For example, if the problem is 2 + 3 = ?, the student might write 5 in the blank and then, if the problem is followed by 2 + 3 = 5, they might add the 5 again. This is also coupled with potential counting errors if they have to count."
17,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student is unsure of the meaning of the equal sign, potentially interpreting it as 'put the answer here' without understanding the equivalence relationship. They might also be struggling with the concept of combining sets."
18,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as a 'put the answer here' marker, rather than representing equivalence. They calculate only what's on the left side and write the result on the right, disregarding the problem's structure or context. For example, for the problem '3 + 2 = ? + 1', they would likely calculate 3+2=5 and simply write 5 in the question mark's place, disregarding the right side of the equation and possibly rewriting it as 3 + 2 = 5 + 1 which is wrong."
19,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student thinks the equal sign means 'put the answer here' and doesn't understand the equivalence relationship. They may write a number that is the sum of the numbers presented, or they might not put any number in the correct position."
20,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as a signal to do something, usually add the numbers presented, without correctly understanding the notion of balance or equivalence. They may simply write down the answer to the first number they see, or add all the numbers, not necessarily the numbers on both sides of the equal sign."
21,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts the number of elements on each side and equates them, not understanding the relational aspect of the equal sign. They see the numbers and treats the equal sign as the word ""and"" or a pause, not a symbol of balance."
22,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign indicates a command to 'put the answer here' rather than the relationship of equivalence between the two sides of the equation. They may focus on adding all numbers presented regardless of the equal sign's placement, or perceive it as a signal for the result."
23,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand that the equal sign represents equivalence and mistakenly views it as a command to do something. They might attempt to add or manipulate numbers on either side without understanding the relationship between them.
24,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as 'add to' or 'the answer is coming next,' not as a symbol of equivalence. They may focus on the action of combining numbers shown on the left side rather than understanding that both sides must represent the same total value. They may attempt to compute the left side, and then simply write that result as the entire answer, without recognizing the numbers on the right are supposed to relate to the left side's result. Alternatively they may randomly choose a number to represent the sum they're calculating"
25,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student might believe the equal sign means 'put the answer here' or 'the total' and struggles with the concept of equivalence, particularly if the equation is not in a standard 'answer on the right' format. For example, given '3 + 2 = ? + 1', the student might calculate 3+2 = 5, and write '5 + 1' or just '5' in the blank without understanding the need to make both sides equal."
26,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student believes the equal sign means 'put the answer here' without understanding the balance it represents. They might just write down a number they see or pick a number randomly without performing any operation.
27,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of equality and might interpret the equal sign as 'the answer is coming next' or as a signal to do something, not a balance between two sides. They might focus on the numbers involved and their order without understanding the relationship between the left and right sides of the equation. They may not recognize the equal sign's relational meaning, failing to see the left side's value is equal to the right side's."
28,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts all the objects together, regardless of the equal sign representing equivalence. They don't understand the need for the quantities on both sides to be the same."

30,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student treats the equal sign as an instruction to 'do something' rather than a balance. They might add all numbers together regardless of which side of the equals sign they are on, or see the equal sign as another number to add."
31,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student doesn't understand the concept of equality and sees the equal sign as an operation to 'make' something.
32,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses the equal sign with the concept of 'adding to get the answer'. They might treat it as a direction to perform an operation, rather than a statement of equivalence. For example, if the problem is '3 + 2 = ?', the student might count on their fingers to get to 5, and then write '5' thinking the equal sign means 'the answer is'. However, if the problem is '5 = 2 + ?', the student may struggle or provide an incorrect answer because they may not understand that the equal sign indicates a balance or that the quantity on both sides of the equation should be the same."
33,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as an instruction to add all the numbers together on both sides of the equation, rather than showing equivalence."
34,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student incorrectly understands that the equal sign signifies a 'do' action instead of representing equivalence. They might attempt to 'add' or 'combine' elements on both sides of the equation as if it were a command.
35,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles with the concept of equivalence and may misinterpret the equal sign as 'the answer comes after'.
36,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign, treating it as an instruction to 'add everything together' or perform an operation on the numbers presented, rather than representing balance or equivalence. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ? + 1, the student might say 3 + 2 = 5, then add 1 (from the other side of the equal sign), resulting in an answer of 6, and then say 6 equals 6."
37,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the concept of equality. They might add all the numbers together, or only focus on the numbers on the left side, ignoring the right side or the equal sign."
38,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as an instruction to 'do' something rather than a statement of equivalence. They may attempt to solve a problem like '3 + 2 = ?' by only finding the sum and not understanding that the equal sign means the same amount on both sides. They might also misunderstand problems with an unknown on the left side or in the middle of an equation, like ' ? = 5 + 1' or '2 + ? = 4'."
39,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign as a 'total' or 'answer' indicator and doesn't recognize the need for balance or equivalence. They may add everything they see together, regardless of the operation."
40,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand the commutative property and sees the equals sign as a prompt for action rather than a statement of equivalence. They may add everything present on the left side and then ignore what's on the right, or they may just perform an operation on the first number."
41,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign signifies 'put together' rather than equivalence. For example, if presented with 2 + 3 = ? , the student might draw 2 objects, then 3 objects, and then attempt to combine *only* the 2 and the 3 without understanding that the question mark implies finding a single value which is same as the value of (2+3)."
42,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to combine or simplify numbers without a clear understanding of what the equal sign represents (e.g., treating it as a command to 'do something' rather than a balance)."

47,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student believes the equal sign signifies 'put together' or 'the answer is coming next', rather than signifying equivalence. They might not understand the relationship between the left and right sides of the equation. For example, in '2 + 3 = ?' they might write 5 directly after the equals sign without recognizing that the left side and right side represent the same quantity, or they might write something unrelated."
48,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student may not understand the meaning of the equal sign as representing equivalence. They might focus on the operation on the left side and see the equal sign as a signal to perform a different operation, or as a command to write a number in a specific way."
49,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Understanding the equal sign,The student views the equal sign as a signal to 'put the answer' rather than a symbol indicating equivalence between two sides of an equation. They focus on the operation before and after the equal sign.

They might add all the numbers together on both sides and find a 'total' rather than understanding that the two sides must result in the same value.
51,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student interprets the equal sign as an instruction to add all numbers presented, regardless of the operation symbols. They may not understand the concept of equivalence or that the equal sign represents 'the same amount as'."
52,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student understands the equal sign as a signal to perform an operation, but doesn't grasp the concept of balance or equivalence. They might focus on finding the total on one side and then copying that total to the other, regardless of the given numbers."
53,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign's function. They may interpret it as 'and then' or 'put together', rather than representing equivalence between both sides.

54,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student counts the objects on one side of the equal sign and attempts to match that number on the other side, ignoring the operation. For example, given '2 + 3 = ?', the student might draw 5 objects but not consider what goes on the right side (e.g., 5), or given '5 = ?', might only draw 5 objects without understanding the number on the other side. This is a common misunderstanding where the student focuses on the number of objects only and not on the mathematical expression and the meaning of the equal sign as a balance or equivalence."
55,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student doesn't understand that the equal sign indicates balance and equivalence, potentially focusing on procedural addition/subtraction without conceptual understanding. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = ?"
56,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student focuses on the order of the numbers in the equal sign instead of understanding equivalence.

65,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student misunderstands the equal sign's meaning. They may view it as an instruction to 'write the answer' following only the numbers present, ignoring the operational context. Perhaps they focus on the sequence presented and not the relationships within the equation. The concept of 'same amount' is unclear, and the student could be focusing on a rule like adding all numbers or simply writing the last number."

76,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student focuses on the number of symbols on each side of the equals sign rather than the quantity, or struggles to grasp the concept of equivalence. For example, if the problem is 3 + 2 = __ + 1, the student might write '5' in the blank, disregarding the '+ 1' on the right side because they see 2 symbols on the left and only 1 on the right side. Or, the student might write any random number because they don't understand that the sums on each side of the equal sign must be equal. A more advanced misunderstanding for the student may be counting all symbols and filling in the answer accordingly. "
77,K1,Numbers and Operations,The meaning of the equal sign,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student views the equal sign as an operational signal to perform the operation to its left, rather than representing equivalence.

The student doesn't grasp the concept of equality as balance. Perhaps the student is confused by the order, thinking the answer should always follow the numbers in the order they see them, or they might have misunderstood an earlier example.

2,K2,Numbers and Operations,word problems,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with the concept of 'how many more'. They might misinterpret it as addition instead of subtraction, or confuse the order of the numbers when subtracting. For example, if the problem is 'Sarah has 5 apples and John has 3 apples.

Or they might correctly have the answer 123, however not fully understanding the different values of each digit."
89,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student confuses the place values in a multi-digit number, specifically the ones, tens, and hundreds place. They might write the digits in reverse order or misinterpret their value when adding."
90,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student struggles with place value and might misinterpret the meaning of multiple digits within a larger number. For example, they might not recognize the difference between 100 and 1000 and attempt to apply addition or subtraction incorrectly by combining digits from different place values."
91,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student attempts to 'solve' the addition problem by creating a new number using the digits in the original numbers, rather than adding the place values correctly. They may not understand place value or the operation of addition."
92,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student struggles to accurately identify the place value of digits beyond hundreds, potentially misinterpreting thousands as hundreds or confusing the order of place values."
93,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Procedural Error,"The student misunderstands place value when adding, possibly misaligning digits or carrying incorrectly. For example, attempting to add 123,456 + 789,012 and getting an answer like 800,000 or 1000,000 without considering the actual values of each place."
94,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student confuses place value when reading a number in the millions and may misread/miswrite the value, particularly mixing up hundreds, thousands, or millions. For example, they might read 1,234,567 as 'one thousand two hundred thirty-four thousand five hundred sixty-seven' (correctly for the numbers but missing the 'million'). Or, they might try to directly add digits from different place values."
95,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student struggles to differentiate between place values when reading or writing numbers, potentially confusing hundreds, thousands, and millions. They might misread 1,234,567 as 'one hundred twenty-three thousand, four hundred fifty-six' or write '2 millions, 3 thousands, 5 hundreds, 7 ones' as 2357."
96,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,"The student incorrectly identifies place value or misinterprets number formation. For example, when asked to write 'one hundred and thirty-five thousand and seventy-two', the student might write 13500072, or 13572000 instead of 135072, confusing the place values of the hundreds, thousands, and tens/ones."
97,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student misinterprets the place value of digits, particularly in numbers with zeros. For instance, they might add 10,000 + 500 as 1500, ignoring the need for zeros in the thousands and tens places."
98,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Place Value Confusion,"The student struggles to identify the value of digits based on their position. May confuse hundreds with thousands, or tens with ones."
99,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Conceptual misunderstanding,The student struggles with place value beyond hundreds and misinterprets the relationship between different place values. They may not understand the grouping in thousands or millions.
100,K4,Numbers and Operations,whole numbers up to the millions,Procedural error,"The student miscounts the number of places in a multi-digit number, potentially misinterpreting place value. For example, they might add or subtract digits in the wrong columns, leading to an incorrect result. They may also not understand 'millions' and just perceive it as a very big number, making estimation difficult."
